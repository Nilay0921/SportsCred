She is friendly and has a knack for creating an environment where people feel comfortable to be themselves and contribute their skills/opinions without fear of judgment.

### Key Scenarios:
Peter’s wife becomes very ill and Peter chooses to stay at home to look after her. Taking time off work and being unable to volunteer has provided Peter ample time to watch sports games on television. As someone who spends most of his day communicating and interacting with others, he needs mental stimulation and an outlet to discuss current gameplay.

Rebecca is informed that she is being considered for promotion at work, but that there are only a handful of positions to be filled. Rebecca believes that she has the strong interpersonal and technical skills needed to take on a new position, but wants to set herself apart from others. Rebecca is convinced that she must show initiative by improving the developing employee morale and absenteeism issues. She knows that sports is a well-liked topic and wants to introduce a fun and strategic sports-related activity such as team picks and predictions to her firm.

### Key Principles:
* Accuracy and validity of the Analyst Credibility Score (A.C.S) – A.C.S. scores should accurately represent one’s knowledge and ability to analyze basketball games.
* Enjoyment in earning A.C.S scores and engaging with other users – The process of earning a higher A.C.S. score should be satisfying and users should be proud of the effort and skill required to earn their scores. Users should find enjoyment in their ability to interact with other users.
* Functionality over visual appeal – Although it is important to reach a balance between good app design and functionality, functionality and ease of use should not be sacrificed for high visual appeal.
