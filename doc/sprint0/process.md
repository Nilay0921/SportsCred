# Process

### Team Organization:
The team communicated via discord for meetings and announcements and used google docs to record decisions/work/ planning/progress. In the first meeting,  deliverables for sprint 0 were distributed among team members or a subset of the team based on preferences, and was agreed upon by the entire team. Each team member held the role of completing their assigned work and communicating their progress during the meetings. Certain deliverables such as the Product Backlog, Process, and Done were worked on together.

This was the work distribution (quoted from discord):
* Nilay and Malhar doing Competition
* Naomi doing Personas
* Sameer and William doing UI/UX
* Everyone doing Product Backlog in the next few days (meeting time: T.B.D) 
* Summary, Done, and Process all together later in the week

### Decision Making: 
First, whoever is responsible for the work would present their points/arguments/ideas, then the group would debate on whether they would agree or not, discussing until we come to a conclusion by consensus. Each of the topics/discussion was agreed upon by every member of the team.

### Prioritizing User Stories: 
The team in a group meeting read through each user story and its acceptance criteria and agreed upon an estimation and priority level for each user story based on its criteria. A group member (William in this case), was in charge of keeping the team on track, and keeping the session organized. Although rare, any disagreement was discussed and voted upon again with the team. When there were disagreements, we had additional rounds of discussion (usually 2). 

### Meetings: 
Held online through Discord calls. Every meeting we would first catch up on what was accomplished in the past 2 days, what obstacles we faced, and a newer estimation of completion of the assigned task. We would then discuss how to overcome these obstacles and determine what resources should be redistributed. Then we would proceed with our agenda for the meeting which is decided beforehand. At the end of each meeting, we decide on the next meeting time and plan out what must be completed in that meeting. This allows us to make sure that meetings are always held and everyone is on the same page. We will be having Discord calls on Tuesdays from 6-7pm and Thursdays from 1-2pm.

### Next Phase: 
* Discuss progress in every meeting
* Set fixed times for the meetings
* Start early
* Encourage more active participation
