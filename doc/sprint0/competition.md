# How is SportCred different?
SportCred has a discussion forum where users can discuss recent topics on basketball (NBA), and express their opinions. It supports cross-posting from different social media. SportCred has a point-based ranking system with an original "A.C.S" algorithm. Users can earn points through picks and predictions, trivia, as well as competing with other users in debates on controversial topics in the NBA. SportCred is an app for passionate viewers of the game to engage in healthy discussions. It provides a way to quantify your knowledge on the game.

# How is SportCred better?
* SportCred incorporates an "A.C.S" algorithm which is first of its kind and an arguably better metric to quantify the user's knowledge. ESPN fantasy (probably) wanted a simpler scoring meahnism and so decided to go with a streak based system. For ESPN to switch to a "better" point-based metric, they would need to either reset the current user streaks/ranks or find a way to convert the streak count to a point-based system.
* It is one of the few if not the only platform which allows both picks and predictions, and a user-generated discussion forum. Other platforms chose not to implement this idea because of their existing independent discussions on their social media posts, and other discussion forums. To implement this they would be required to allow users to cross-post and generate their own posts. They would also need to monitor these posts for misinformation, especially in the case that they allow betting on picks.
