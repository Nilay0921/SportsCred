# Done

A feature is deemed “done” when:
  - The feature is functional, i.e. the requirements made in the product backlog are satisfied
  - The feature is integrable to the project (doesn’t conflict with any other feature of the programs)
  - The feature is easily extendable (properly documented, cleaner code, architecture, etc.)
