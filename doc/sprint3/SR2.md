## Analysis of practices
 - Could have broken down the user stories further
 - Due to many assignment due dates and midterms, we overestimated our capacity
 - Communication between frontend and backend could be better
 - Good communication between team members in daily standups
 - Could have prepared more for demo to ensure smooth flow
 - Slow to add a few subtasks and assignments on Jira
 - Slow to update progress of user stories on Jira
 - Code could have been committed/pushed more frequently
